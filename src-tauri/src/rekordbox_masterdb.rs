//! Pure-Rust reader **and** Tier 1 write engine for Rekordbox's SQLCipher-encrypted
//! `master.db` (see `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-03-rekordbox-masterdb-sqlcipher-reader-design.md`
//! for the reader, `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-06-m8-tier1-write-path-rust-design-v2.md`
//! for the write engine). Reads (`read_rekordbox_masterdb`) are always safe; the write
//! path (`repair_track_path`) is only ever reached through an explicit, user-confirmed
//! IPC call (`ipc_library::rekordbox_masterdb_apply_repairs`) and owns its own
//! guard/backup/verify/rollback safety chain — nothing here writes `master.db` as a side
//! effect of a read.
//!
//! # Approach
//!
//! Rather than reimplementing SQLite's on-disk B-tree format, this module only
//! decrypts each SQLCipher page to plaintext, reassembles a standard
//! (unencrypted) SQLite file buffer in memory, and hands that buffer to
//! `rusqlite` via [`rusqlite::Connection::deserialize_read_exact`] — the rest
//! (B-tree parsing, SQL queries) is then plain SQLite, already proven inside
//! Sift. The decrypted buffer is never written to disk.
//!
//! # SQLCipher v4 parameters (empirically confirmed, not assumed)
//!
//! Confirmed against a real `sqlcipher3` connection (`PRAGMA kdf_iter`,
//! `PRAGMA cipher_kdf_algorithm`, `PRAGMA cipher_hmac_algorithm`) and by a
//! full round-trip decrypt of a synthetic fixture (all pages HMAC-verified,
//! reconstructed buffer readable by stdlib SQLite):
//!
//! - Key derivation: PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512, 256 000 iterations, 32-byte key.
//! - HMAC key derivation: PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512, salt XORed with `0x3a`, 2
//!   iterations, 32-byte key.
//! - Page size: 4096 bytes. Reserve: 80 bytes (16-byte IV + 64-byte
//!   HMAC-SHA512 — already a multiple of the AES block size, no extra
//!   padding).
//! - Per-page HMAC covers `ciphertext || iv || page_number` (`page_number`
//!   as little-endian `u32`, 1-indexed), verified *before* decryption.
//! - Page 1 special case: the first 16 bytes on disk are the (unencrypted)
//!   salt; only `page_size - 16 - reserve` bytes of page 1 are ciphertext.
//!
//! Note: the SQLite magic string `"SQLite format 3\0"` lives in that
//! never-encrypted salt region, so it is *not* usable as a correctness
//! check (it "matches" even with a wrong key). Correctness here is
//! established by the per-page HMAC (fail-fast) plus the fact that the
//! reassembled buffer parses as a valid SQLite database.
//!
//! # Status
//!
//! Wired to IPC: `read_rekordbox_masterdb` (via `actions::detect_masterdb_repair_if_linked`,
//! read-only), `repair_track_path` (Tier 1, via `ipc_library::rekordbox_masterdb_apply_repairs`),
//! `dedup_playlist_group` (Tier 2). `sync_track_metadata` (Tier 3, metadata
//! find-or-create) is proven on fixture + a real `master.db` copy
//! (`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-09-m8-tier3-metadata-sync-rust.md`) but
//! **not yet wired to IPC or a filing-time hook** — same "engine first"
//! precedent as Tier 1/2, follow-up plan pending.
//!
//! # Real-copy tests run one at a time
//!
//! The 3 `#[ignore]`d `*_round_trips_on_real_masterdb_copy` tests (Tier 1/2/3)
//! all read `SIFT_M8_REAL_COPY_DIR` and mutate the *same* `master.db` file —
//! `cargo test -- --ignored` runs tests in parallel by default, so running
//! more than one of them in the same invocation races on that file and
//! produces spurious failures (discovered 2026-07-09 running all 3 together).
//! Always filter to exactly one: `cargo test --lib -- --exact
//! rekordbox_masterdb::tests::<test_name> --ignored --test-threads=1`.
