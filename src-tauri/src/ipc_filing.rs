//! IPC surface for the M4 filing loop: reconcile / file / reject / trash a track, manage
//! destination bins, read & write settings, and undo. Thin wrappers that lock the shared
//! Connection, resolve the library root from settings, delegate to the domain modules
//! (naming/encode/tagging/library/actions/filing/settings), and emit `queue:changed` after
//! any mutation so the front refreshes. Errors are flattened to strings (Tauri convention);
//! a missing library root surfaces as the sentinel `"NoLibraryRoot"` so the front can route
//! the user to the settings panel rather than show a raw message.
//!
//! Note: the slow ffmpeg encode runs OUTSIDE the DB lock. `file_track` splits plan/execute/commit
//! so the lock is released around the encode; `file_batch` runs detached on a background thread and
//! takes the lock PER FILE — so a long filing never freezes the UI nor blocks the analysis worker.
//! Since P5 (PRD 2026-07-27, D3/D5) `file_track` is detached too: the invoke returns as soon as the
//! plan is settled and the encode runs on a background thread that reports through
//! `file:track:done` — the click is acknowledged, the conversion finishes behind it.
//! The same rule now holds for every other disk-touching command here: `reconcile` (tag read),
//! `trash_track` (byte-for-byte copy) and `list_bins` (recursive walk of the library tree) resolve
//! what they need under the lock, release it, do the I/O, and only re-take it to write.
